    To add:
    
    Test against suspension-analyzer to make sure my math is good
    
    // DONE Calculate the effect of roll (for bump and camber)
        =dependent on track width
        =show it visually? (need to show both wheels)
    
    3) Show 2d effect of anti-dive
        -calculate anti-dive %
        -show suspension from side view (w/anti-dive line?)
    
    4) Stop worrying so much.
        -This is about doing something meaningful
        -The whole reason I'm stressed and frustrated, is because I'm worrying about money
    
    5) Make and Show 3d calculations?
        -The calculations will be much easier than showing them.
        -To show them, I will need 3d modeling software?
            =this may not be worth it
    
     The longer you wait, the harder actions becomes.
        -I haven't known what to do this whole time, and look how far I've got, look how much I've learned






    
    Random Ideas:
    -can wix add sign in capabilities with a drag and drop (like creating all of the underlying systems with just a drag);
    
    -how much slower will heavy programs be in the browser? (3d modelling?)
        +even if it's just running on your computer, not loading from internet (like a js computer app)
    
    -what if you have 'memories' that only the people "in" the memory can see?
        +plus you have a personal 'notes' about the memory that only you can see?
    
    Just work on it in your spare time.
        -remember why I was building it in the first place?
            =to have an easy accessible journal to be able to look back on my life
